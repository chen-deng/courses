### Steps to run Project 1 code

The entire code is contained in a single python file named `proj1.py`

1. Clone the repository

    ```
    $ git clone https://...
    ```

2. Make sure you have `numpy` installed. It is installed if the following code
runs without any errors

    ```
    $ python -c "import numpy"
    ```

3. Run the code

    ```
    $ python proj1.py
    ```

4. Your working directory should have files `fig3.pdf`, `fig4.pdf`, and 
`fig5.pdf`. 

Thats it!
